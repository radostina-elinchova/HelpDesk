## 🗄️ Database Setup

The project uses **Entity Framework Core** with a Code-First approach.

Connection string is configured in `appsettings.json`:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=YourDbName;Trusted_Connection=True;"
}
```

To create and seed the database:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Key settings in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "your-connection-string-here"
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information"
    }
  }
}
```

> ⚠️ **Never commit sensitive data** (passwords, API keys) to source control. Use `appsettings.Development.json` or environment variables for local secrets.
